uses CMake for cross-platform targets including Windows and Linux. While CMake isn't my first choice, it is the most obvious one for C++ projects for many reasons outside the scope of this post.\nWhat sucks about CMake is the documentation is very lacking in examples and the examples out in the wild are usually not \"modern\" CMake but legacy stuff that you really should avoid if you don't want to drive yourself crazy.\nSo today we're going to look at how Hotarubi uses CMake and hopefully this will be useful for anyone trying to start a new CMake project.\nHotarubi is a very modular project. It's divided up into a number of components:\n\n\nsrc/common: A library that contains code common to all projects. This includes things like the logger, various bit manipulation, string, and file helpers among other things.\n\n\nsrc/core: The core emulation logic.\n\n\nsrc/frontend: Frontend code that is common to all user interfaces including the terminal.\n\n\nsrc/gui: Contains code for graphical user interfaces and the entry point.\n\n\nsrc/version: A special project that interfaces with Git to automatically generate headers that will be used for presenting version information to the user.\n\n\nsrc/video: Code for rendering.\n\n\ndepends: Git submodules and build files for all of the projects external dependencies.\n\n\nEach of these directories and sub-directories maintains it's own CMakeLists.txt so we need to first include all of them in a top-level CMakeLists.txt:\n# ./CMakeLists.txt\n# set this to whatever suits your project\ncmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16)\n# set the project name\nproject(Hotaru C CXX)\n# bring in the dependencies\nadd_subdirectory(depends)\n# bring in the source tree\nadd_subdirectory(src)\n\nNext we include our dependencies:\n# ./depends/CMakeLists.txt\n# https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt\nadd_subdirectory(fmt)\n# ...\n\nAnd finally our individual modules:\n# ./src/CMakeLists.txt\n# static libraries\nadd_subdirectory(common)\nadd_subdirectory(core)\nadd_subdirectory(frontend)\nadd_subdirectory(version)\nadd_subdirectory(video)\n# executable\nadd_subdirectory(gui)\n\nAs you can imagine, having all these individual modules and external libraries makes it difficult to manage compiler settings and especially so when they share settings in common. A very WET solution would be simply to repeat these settings in every module:\n# ./src/frontend/CMakeLists.txt\nadd_library(frontend\n  # ...\n)\n\ntarget_compile_options(frontend PRIVATE\n  # MSVC compiler options\n  $&lt;$&lt;CXX_COMPILER_ID:MSVC&gt;:/W4 /WX /utf-8&gt;\n  # Clang and GCC\n  $&lt;$&lt;NOT:$&lt;CXX_COMPILER_ID:MSVC&gt;&gt;:-Wall -Wextra -Werror&gt;\n)\n\ntarget_include_directories(frontend PRIVATE\n  \"${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/src\"\n)\n\ntarget_link_libraries(frontend PRIVATE\n  fmt::fmt\n  # ...\n)\n\nBut now if I want to enable any additional settings I have to edit 6 CMakeLists.txt and that sucks. Instead it would be nicer to define some global settings and then add any module-specific settings on a per-project basis. For exmaple, perhaps I'd like to link fmt with every project while also having private dependencies for managing the dependency chain of the various src/ projects. \nYou might have noticed that PRIVATE is peppered throughout those settings. We obviosly don't want these settings to be private. The next obvious choice is PUBLIC and if we set target_include_directories to PUBLIC it might have the effect of making that directory visible to all projects but we still need to associate it with a project that includes source files (frontend in this case) so it's not a very elegant solution.\nInstead we can use a slightly lesser known setting INTERFACE:\n\nCreates an Interface Library. An INTERFACE library target does not compile sources and does not produce a library artifact on disk. However, it may have properties set on it and it may be installed and exported.\n-source\n\nCreating an interface library is useful to us because unlike normal libraries we don't need to associate any files with it:\n# creates an interface library called \"ProjectConfiguration\"\nadd_library(ProjectConfiguration INTERFACE)\n\nWe could just include this in our top-level CMakeLists.txt but I like to keep it in a separate file in .cmake/build_configuration.cmake. This isn't required, it's just how I choose to organize things (actually I believe convention is to call the directory CMake but I like to hide these directories from an ls command because they're mostly noise to me).\nIf you do decide to put it in a separate place then just modify the top-level CMakeLists.txt to include this file before our modules:\n# ./CMakeLists.txt\n# set this to whatever suits your project\ncmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16)\n# set the project name\nproject(Hotaru C CXX)\n# bring in our global build configuration\ninclude(.cmake/project_configuration.cmake)\n# bring in the dependencies\nadd_subdirectory(depends)\n# bring in the source tree\nadd_subdirectory(src)\n\nThen we can just create .cmake/build_configuration.cmake and populate it with our interface library just like any normal library (minus the source files, of course):\n# ./.cmake/build_configuration.cmake\n# https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED.html\nset(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)\n\n# create an interface that will be used for the entire project\nadd_library(ProjectConfiguration INTERFACE)\n\n# global compiler settings\ntarget_compile_options(ProjectConfiguration INTERFACE\n  # MSVC compiler options\n  $&lt;$&lt;CXX_COMPILER_ID:MSVC&gt;:/W4 /WX /utf-8&gt;\n  # Clang and GCC\n  $&lt;$&lt;NOT:$&lt;CXX_COMPILER_ID:MSVC&gt;&gt;:-Wall -Wextra -Werror&gt;\n)\n\n# global include directories\ntarget_include_directories(ProjectConfiguration INTERFACE \n  \"${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/src\"\n)\n\n# global features\ntarget_compile_features(ProjectConfiguration INTERFACE\n  cxx_std_20\n)\n\n# global linked libraries\ntarget_link_libraries(ProjectConfiguration INTERFACE\n  fmt::fmt\n)\n\nFinally we can just link our build configuration library with all our projects and put it in the back of our minds where it belongs:\n# create the frontend library\nadd_library(frontend\n  # ...\n)\n\n# link our dependencies\ntarget_link_libraries(frontend PRIVATE\n  ProjectConfiguration\n  common\n  core\n  version\n)\n\n","id":"https://hotarubiemu.github.io/cmake-global-build-configuration/","title":"CMake: Global Build Configuration"},"https://hotarubiemu.github.io/programmatically-discover-hyper-v-guest/":{"body":"Hotarubi includes some fancy detection for virtual machine guests. There isn't any particular rationale for this other than I simply wanted to spend an evening working on it (I might have some ideas for it later down the road). I do imagine, however, there are other uses for this so I figured I'd write up a quick post about my not-so-straightforward journey in detecting Hyper-V guests.\n\nThis post will focus specifically on Hyper-V but the ideas and methodology here can be applied to most any hypervisor.\n\nLet's start with a simple explanation of a special cpu instruction called cpuid. It is used on x86 and x86-64 processors to request information about the cpu the code is currently executing on. The caller specifies a sub-function of the cpuid instruction by passing an integer value known as a \"leaf\" in the eax register. cpuid returns information pertaining to that leaf in the eax, ebx, ecx and edx registers.\n\nThere are additionally sub-sub-functions known as \"subleaves\" passed via ecx but most of the time we want this value to be 0 for the default subleaf. None of the cpuid leafs I'm using in this post require subleaves but it's worth noting their existence.\n\nDon't worry if this sounds a little low-level because most compilers support special functions called \"intrinsics\" that do the work of writing the assembly for you. Unfortunately, they're different depending on your compiler so I'll provide a quick generic version so we can be on our way:\n#include &lt;stdbool.h&gt;\n#if defined(_MSC_VER)\n#include &lt;intrin.h&gt; // __cpuid\n#else\n#include &lt;cpuid.h&gt; // __cpuid\n#endif\n\n// calls the cpuid instruction\n// populates the eax, ebx, ecx, and edx variables with their respective values.\n// this follows the GCC convention\nvoid cpuid(int leaf, int* eax, int* ebx, int* ecx, int* edx)\n{\n#if defined(_MSC_VER) // MSVC\n  int data[4];\n  __cpuid(data, leaf);\n  \n  *eax = data[0];\n  *ebx = data[1];\n  *ecx = data[2];\n  *edx = data[3];\n#else // GCC and Clang\n  __cpuid(leaf, eax, ebx, ecx, edx);\n#endif\n}\n\nWhat is important to know is that each vendor (AMD, Intel, VIA, etc) maintains their own range of cpuid leaves with some overlap (for example, AMD and Intel often use each other's leaves to avoid the need for vendor-specific duplicates of certain features like detecting SSE4 support or obtaining the CPU model).\nThere is also a special range of leaves that both AMD and Intel essentially promise never to use because their functionality is resevered for a special purpose: hypervisors.\n\n\"A hypervisor (also known as a virtual machine monitor, VMM, or virtualizer) is a type of computer software, firmware or hardware that creates and runs virtual machines. A computer on which a hypervisor runs one or more virtual machines is called a host machine, and each virtual machine is called a guest machine.\" -source\n\nThe hypervisor range starts with leaf 0x40000000 which defines the highest accepted leaf in that range as well as a vendor name enocded as ascii in the 3 remaining 32-bit integers (which is to say, 12 characters).\nBefore we can use this range however, we need to check for the presence of a hypervisor. That is done by checking a specific bit of the ecx register of the 0x00000001 leaf:\nbool hypervisor_present(void)\n{\n  int eax, ebx, ecx, edx;\n  // this function is almost gurenteed to be supported on any processor\n  // made in the past 20 years so I'm assuming support for it here.\n  cpuid(0x00000001, &amp;eax, &amp;ebx, &amp;edx, &amp;ecx);\n\n  // check the last bit of ecx\n  // the \"hypervisor present\" bit\n  return (ecx &gt;&gt; 31) &amp; 1;\n}\n\nThis bit will tell us if we're in a virtual machine and whether we can use the hypervisor leaves to give us information about the environment the guest is running in. You might think to yourself \"Well job well done, we've programmatically figured out that we're in a virtual machine. Post complete. Roll credits!\".\nUnfortunately, like many things in the land of Microsoft, it's not that simple. There is a curious property of some hypervisors: the host operating system runs as a virtual guest with extra privileges to manage other guests.\nSuch is the case for Microsoft's kernel-level hypervisor. This will be true so long as virtualization support is enabled in the bios. Yes, it will be true even if your Windows install is Home edition. Whenever you have cpu virtualization support enabled Windows will boot you into a special Hyper-V guest that will set the hypervisor bit to 1.\nSo essentially there are two types of Hyper-V guests:\n\nThe \"host\" guest or \"root partition\" that manages all the other guests.\nThe \"guest\" guest or virtual machine.\n\n\nThis is also apparently true for Zen though I haven't independently verified that for myself. Regardless, each hypervisor interfaces with the hypervisor bit and hypervisor leaves in their own way so consider reading the code or documentation for any you wish to detect.\n\nSo we need to query the hypervisor leaves for more information about if we're a root partition or not. Before we can do that, however, we need to make sure that we can query the hypervisor leaves. Accessing them otherwise is undefined as the values returned by unsupported leaves can vary by vendor and cpu model:\nbool hypervisor_leaf_supported(int leaf)\n{\n  // we aren't going to use these but they are the 12 ascii\n  // characters of the vendor name of the hypervisor in order\n  int vendor_0, vendor_1, vendor_2;\n  \n  // this number represents the highest leaf in the\n  // 0x40000000 range we can use for future cpuid calls\n  int highest_hypervisor_leaf;\n\n  // no hypervisor and therefor no hypervisor leaves.\n  // on Windows this is probably because you don't\n  // have virtualization enabled in the bios.\n  if (!hypervisor_present())\n    return false;\n    \n  // ignore any leaves not in the 0x40000000 range\n  if ((leaf &amp; 0x40000000) != 0x40000000)\n    return false;\n\n  cpuid(0x40000000, &amp;highest_hypervisor_leaf, &amp;vendor_0, &amp;vendor_1, &amp;vendor_2);\n  \n  return leaf &lt;= highest_hypervisor_leaf;\n}\n\nOur next step is to check leaf 0x40000001. This leaf is designed to tell us about the hypervisor cpuid interface. It's important we query this information because unlike the Intel and AMD leaves, the leaves following 0x4000001 are subject to changes and differences depending on vendor for the same leaves.\n// integer representation of the ascii \"Hv#1\"\n#define MS_HYPER_V 0x31237628\n\nbool hypervisor_interface_hyperv(void)\n{\n  // 4-bytes of ascii representing the interface name\n  int interface_signature;\n  \n  // reserved and unused\n  int ebx, ecx, edx;\n\n  // hyper-v implies this leaf is supported\n  // so if it's not then it's not hyper-v\n  if (!hypervisor_leaf_supported(0x40000001))\n    return false;\n\n  cpuid(0x40000001, &amp;interface_signature, &amp;ebx, &amp;ecx, &amp;edx);\n\n  // you can opt for a string comparison here instead\n  // just make sure you null terminate\n  return interface_signature == MS_HYPER_V;\n}\n\nNow that we've got the boilerplate for detecting the Hyper-V cpuid interface and detecting hypervisor presence we need to query the Hyper-V cpuid interface for a certain value. There are two ways to do this but for now I'm going to stick to how the Linux kernel does it: by checking for cpu management support.\nIn order to do that we need to check the HV_PARTITION_PRIVILEGE_MASK. Thankfully Microsoft has mapped it to eax and ebx of leaf 0x40000003. eax contains the lower 32 bits and ebx contains the upper 32 bits. We need bit 43 which would be bit 11 of the upper 32 bits and therefor bit 11 of ebx:\nbool hyperv_host(void)\n{\n  // lower 32-bits of HV_PARTITION_PRIVILEGE_MASK\n  int priv_mask_lower;\n  \n  // upper 32-bits of HV_PARTITION_PRIVILEGE_MASK\n  int priv_mask_upper;\n  \n  // unused\n  int ecx, edx;\n\n  // no hyper-v hypervisor, so not a hyper-v guest\n  if (!hypervisor_interface_hyperv())\n    return true;\n  \n  // we're hyper-v and support for this leaf is implied\n  cpuid(0x40000003, &amp;priv_mask_lower, &amp;priv_mask_upper, &amp;ecx, &amp;edx);\n  \n  // the cpu management bit of HV_PARTITION_PRIVILEGE_MASK\n  return (priv_mask_upper &gt;&gt; 11) &amp; 1;\n}\n\nThis is the magic bit that is only set when you are running code as the Hyper-V host. So if this bit is not set, then we are a guest.\nint main()\n{\n  if (hyperv_host())\n    printf(\"I'm the host!\");\n  else\n    printf(\"I'm the guest!\");\n  \n  return 0;\n}\n\nAnd with that our yak is sufficiently shaved.\n","id":"https://hotarubiemu.github.io/programmatically-discover-hyper-v-guest/","title":"Programmatically Discover Hyper-V Guests"},"https://hotarubiemu.github.io/using-driver-information-as-a-lesson-in-vulkan-structure-chains/":{"body":"I was working on Hotarubi's driver detection today when it hit me that I don't think I've ever seen a nice and simple explanation of what pNext and sType are in the Vulkan API. Sure, it's documented very well by Khronos themselves but there isn't much in the way of examples and the examples that do exist can be a little hard to find and interpret for the first time Vulkaneer. So I just want to provide a quick overview using a very simple real-word example.\n\nI'll be using Vulkan 1.3 for this example but all of the structures I'll be using are also available for earlier forms of the API as extensions. You will, however, need to query support for them and handle any driver's lack of support accordingly. The implementation details of that are outside the scope of this article.\n\nLet's consider the following chain of Vulkan structures:\n// https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VkPhysicalDeviceProperties2.html\nVkPhysicalDeviceProperties2 device_props =\n{\n  // ..\n};\n\n// https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VkPhysicalDeviceIDPropertiesKHR.html\nVkPhysicalDeviceIDProperties id_props =\n{\n  // ..\n};\n\n// https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VkPhysicalDeviceDriverProperties.html\nVkPhysicalDeviceDriverProperties driver_props =\n{\n  // ..\n};\n\nOur goal is to call vkGetPhysicalDeviceProperties2 with a pointer to VkPhysicalDeviceProperties2 . So our top level structure will be device_props. The order of the other two structures, however, is entirely up to you. So long as they properly set the pNext and sType variables, it will work as expected.\nEssentially, the driver is going to cast the pNext variable to VkBaseOutStructure* and then check the sType variable for a structure type it supports for this function call (it will ignore any other structure types):\ntypedef struct VkBaseOutStructure {\n    VkStructureType               sType;\n    struct VkBaseOutStructure*    pNext;\n} VkBaseOutStructure;\n\nThen it will cast it to the original structure type based on the information in sType and fill it in accordingly. Finally, it will do the same for that structure's pNext variable repeating those steps until it reaches a pNext which is VK_NULL_HANDLE.\nIf this sounds like CS 101, that's because it's basically a singly linked-list with extra steps.\n\nThis is also the reason that you need to boilerplate all your structures with an sType. Vulkan is a C API and as such it cannot know the actual type of the structure from a void pointer alone. It therefore needs the additional sType variable to know what type of structure it is working with and whether the driver supports that structure for a given function call.\nThe most obvious thing to do here is this:\nVkPhysicalDeviceProperties2 device_props = {};\ndevice_props.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_PROPERTIES_2;\n\nVkPhysicalDeviceIDProperties id_props = {};\nid_props.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_ID_PROPERTIES;\n\nVkPhysicalDeviceDriverProperties driver_props = {};\ndriver_props.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_DRIVER_PROPERTIES;\n\ndevice_props.pNext = reinterpret_cast&lt;void*&gt;(&amp;id_props);\nid_props.pNext = reinterpret_cast&lt;void*&gt;(&amp;driver_props);\n// driver_props.pNext = VK_NULL_HANDLE; // implied by = {}\n\nWe can also go this route:\nVkPhysicalDeviceIDProperties id_props =\n{\n  .sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_ID_PROPERTIES,\n  .pNext = VK_NULL_HANDLE,\n};\n\nVkPhysicalDeviceDriverProperties driver_props =\n{\n  .sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_DRIVER_PROPERTIES,\n  .pNext = reinterpret_cast&lt;void*&gt;(&amp;id_props),\n};\n\nVkPhysicalDeviceProperties2 device_props =\n{\n  .sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_PROPERTIES_2,\n  .pNext = reinterpret_cast&lt;void*&gt;(&amp;driver_props),\n};\n\nAnd for all intents and purposes, these are both fine solutions.\nIt does, however, result in some occasionally awkward code. For example, if you want to define your structures without modifying pNext manually after the fact, you need to define them such that they are in the reverse order of their inclusion. Or, alternatively, if you do go setting the various pNext variables after the fact it can get hard to keep track of the chain itself. Both solutions can get even more hairy on earlier versions of the API where you need to query support for these structures before including them in the chain.\nInstead, for a little extra runtime cost we can mimic the driver and do something like this:\n// the types aren't important unless you do some static checking\n// feel free to drop the template and use two void*\ntemplate&lt;typename B, typename T&gt;\ninline void ChainInsert(B* base, T* item)\n{\n  // start at the base\n  auto head = reinterpret_cast&lt;VkBaseOutStructure*&gt;(base);\n\n  // loop until we reach the end of the chain\n  // you might consider runtime checking for a duplicate entry here\n  while (head-&gt;pNext != VK_NULL_HANDLE)\n    head = head-&gt;pNext; \n\n  // we broke the loop so pNext is VK_NULL_HANDLE\n  // we can insert our item here\n  head-&gt;pNext = reinterpret_cast&lt;VkBaseOutStructure*&gt;(item);\n}\n\nThen it's just a matter of calling ChainInsert with our base and the structures we want to include in the chain:\n// first define our structures with pNext as VK_NULL_HANDLE\nVkPhysicalDeviceIDProperties id_props =\n{\n  .sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_ID_PROPERTIES,\n  .pNext = VK_NULL_HANDLE,\n};\n\nVkPhysicalDeviceDriverProperties driver_props =\n{\n  .sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_DRIVER_PROPERTIES,\n  .pNext = VK_NULL_HANDLE,\n};\n\nVkPhysicalDeviceProperties2 device_props =\n{\n  .sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_PROPERTIES_2,\n  .pNext = VK_NULL_HANDLE,\n};\n\n// using the top level struct as the base\nChainInsert(&amp;device_props, &amp;id_props);\nChainInsert(&amp;device_props, &amp;driver_props);\n\n// using the previous item in the chain as the base\n// if, for exmaple, you know it will be included unconditionally\n// ChainInsert(&amp;device_props, &amp;id_props);\n// ChainInsert(&amp;id_props, &amp;driver_props);\n\nRegardless of how you decide to do it, the next step is to call VkPhysicalDeviceProperties2 with our base structure and then we can use the other structs in the chain normally:\nconst VkResult res = VkPhysicalDeviceProperties2(physical_device, &amp;device_props);\nif (res != VK_SUCCESS)\n{\n  // handle failure\n}\n\n// https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VkDriverId.html\n// maybe handle driver errata\nswitch(driver_props.driverID)\n{\n  case VK_DRIVER_ID_MESA_RADV:\n   // ..\n  case VK_DRIVER_ID_AMD_OPEN_SOURCE:\n   // ..\n}\n\n// maybe log the driver name\nprintf(\"driver: %s\\n\", driver_props.driverName);\n\nHopefully that demystified a little of the Vulkan API for you. \n","id":"https://hotarubiemu.github.io/using-driver-information-as-a-lesson-in-vulkan-structure-chains/","title":"Using Driver Information As A Lesson In Vulkan Structure Chains"}},"docInfo":{"https://hotarubiemu.github.io/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://hotarubiemu.github.io/cmake-global-build-configuration/":{"body":480,"title":4},"https://hotarubiemu.github.io/programmatically-discover-hyper-v-guest/":{"body":779,"title":5},"https://hotarubiemu.github.io/using-driver-information-as-a-lesson-in-vulkan-structure-chains/":{"body":458,"title":7}},"length":4},"lang":"English"};
